# TAIK
Attempt to create an AI that plays Tak using Python, and if possible, create some sort of machine learning code that learns how to play the game.

Currently, you can play by yourself, using the mouse, and the program only admits valid moves. Only checks for a road victory at the moment.
Although you can play the game with no issue, the visual aspect of the game is mostly for debugging purposes and checking that everything works as intended, so it is not the focus of the program.

You can check the rules for Tak [here](http://cheapass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tak-Beta-Rules.pdf) or [here](https://ustak.org/play-beautiful-game-tak/), and play it [here](https://www.playtak.com/).
